Universal Caller ID & Crypto for Immigration.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem to Solve.

### Universal Caller ID

Managing unwanted and spam calls is a significant issue for many users. Truecaller is a widely used app that provides call identification, spam call blocking and an organized inbox. However, there is still a need for a better and more decentralized system.

### Crypto + Immigration

It‚Äôs really hard to figure out who to let into the country and who not to. Existing systems, such as Canada‚Äôs points-based immigration system, are hard to design and often fail. A better system would allow citizens to directly participate in the decision-making process by staking crypto on candidates they believe will contribute positively to the economy.

## ‚úÖ Possible Solution.

### **Universal Caller ID** (DePIN Concept)

**Validus** offers a universal caller ID system where contributors are rewarded using decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) concepts:

1. **Decentralized Contribution**: Contributors earn tokens for providing access to their contacts, labeling spam, verifying IDs, etc.
2. **Token Payment System**: Users and businesses pay in tokens for caller ID, verification, login, and other services.
3. **Open Development**: Developers can build apps and tools on the contact network, creating a decentralized ecosystem for managing call identification.

### **Crypto + Immigration System**

The **$TALENT coin** allows citizens to back immigration candidates through a decentralized, self-adjusting referral system:

1. **Government Issuance**: The government issues a certain amount of $TALENT coins to citizens each year.
2. **Citizen Backing**: Citizens stake their $TALENT coins on individuals they believe will add economic value to the country.
3. **Immigration Eligibility**: If candidates accumulate enough $TALENT, they can immigrate and work in the country.
4. **Economic Rewards**: If backed candidates generate economic value (salary, capital), a portion of that value is shared with the $TALENT holders who supported them.
5. **Bonding Curve**: The earlier a citizen backs a successful candidate, the higher percentage of their economic value they earn.
6. **Dynamic Adjustments**: The system is self-adjusting. Citizens who back successful candidates receive more $TALENT to stake next year, while those who back unsuccessful candidates receive less.

This system eliminates the need for arbitrary points-based immigration schemes and allows citizens to directly influence immigration based on their understanding of the country's needs.

## üîÉ Steps to be followed in order to make valid contributions to this repo.

**1.** Fork the [Validus](https://github.com/mrinnnmoy/Validus) repo by clicking on the fork button on the top of the page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

**2.** Clone the forked repository

        git clone "https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Validus"

- Download and install Node JS v16.16.0
- Download and install Git.
- Go to the terminal of your code editor and run "npm install" to download packages.
- Run "npm run dev" to start a local server.

**3.** Make necessary changes and commit those changes. <br />
Remember never push anything to the Main branch. <br />

Always change your branch to "develop" using:

    git checkout develop

Again check your current branch using:

    git branch

It should point \*develop

Now add your changes using:

    git add files-you-edited

If there are multiple files you can use:

    git add .

Now create a commit message using:

    git commit -m "<commit-message-goes-here>"

**4.** Push changes to GitHub

    git push origin develop

**5.** Create a Pull Request üëã<br>

Now you go to your repository on GitHub, you‚Äôll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button and now write a summary of what changes you have done.( Attach images if required). I will review your code and merge it if it passes all the tests.‚ù§Ô∏è
