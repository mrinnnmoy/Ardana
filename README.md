# Ardana

AI-Powered On-Chain Investment Platform for Effortless DeFi Growth.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem to Solve.

Managing DeFi investments is still too complex for most users. Even experienced crypto holders struggle to decide where to allocate assets ‚Äî lending, staking, liquidity provision, yield farming or governance staking ‚Äî across dozens of protocols and chains.

Tracking yields, understanding risks and optimizing returns require constant monitoring, gas spending and manual execution. Users often end up leaving idle stablecoins in wallets or spreading assets across platforms without a unified strategy or dashboard.

There‚Äôs a need for a personalized, automated and transparent on-chain investment assistant that can analyze wallet assets, recommend optimal DeFi strategies and execute investments securely ‚Äî all in one interface.

## ‚úÖ Possible Solution.

**Ardana** is an AI-powered DeFi investment app that lets users deploy, lock and track assets across protocols effortlessly. When a user connects their wallet, Validus automatically analyzes on-chain balances and offers AI-configured investment strategies tailored to the user‚Äôs risk profile, goals, and token holdings. Users can choose to:

- Follow AI Recommendations: Auto-invest in strategies like lending, staking, and liquidity provision for optimized yield.
- Self-Manage Investments: Manually allocate assets across DeFi pools and track all investments in one dashboard.

Once funds are locked, Ardana manages compounding, rebalancing and reinvestment automatically. Users can simply ‚Äúset it and forget it,‚Äù returning later to see their capital working on-chain. It also includes some core features like:
- **AI Strategy Engine:** Analyzes wallet portfolio and market conditions to suggest personalized investment allocations.
- **Unified On-Chain Dashboard:** View and manage all DeFi positions (lending, staking, LPs, vaults) in one place.
- **Smart Locking System:** Allow users to lock funds for chosen periods in AI-generated yield strategies.
- **Cross-Protocol Integration:** Interact with lending, DEX, and staking protocols (Aave, Compound, Lido, Raydium, etc.).
- **Yield & Risk Analytics:** View real-time yield rates, APYs, and risk breakdowns per strategy.
- **Auto-Rebalancing:** Adjust allocations dynamically based on changing market conditions.
- **Portfolio Tracking:** Track wallet balance growth, investment performance, and transaction history seamlessly.
- **Gas & Fee Optimization:** Aggregate on-chain operations to minimize transaction costs.

**3.** Make necessary changes and commit those changes. <br />
Remember never push anything to the Main branch. <br />

Always change your branch to "develop" using:

    git checkout develop

Again check your current branch using:

    git branch

It should point \*develop

Now add your changes using:

    git add files-you-edited

If there are multiple files you can use:

    git add .

Now create a commit message using:

    git commit -m "<commit-message-goes-here>"
